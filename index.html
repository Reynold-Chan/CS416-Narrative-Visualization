  <p>Welcome to the CS416 Visualization Narrative Project by Reynold Chan; this Workbook is meant to be really simple
    and barebone
    with only
    graphs for visualization of the data set being explored. The data set that is being explored is the Amazon Top 50
    best selling books with rating in the past 10 years from 2009-2019 . The data is available at <a
      href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sootersaalu/amazon-top-50-bestselling-books-2009-2019">kaggle </a> Use the
    button to get started.

    The purpose is to explore in particular the relationships to the pricing and other variables including rating, genre
    and years.
