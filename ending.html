        That's the end of this project. Hope you enjoyed playing with a simple but Narravative of the Top selling books
        from Amazon from 2009- 2019 and learned something overall about prices and these books. If you're writing a
        book, you can also take inspiration from this to learn how much to charge a book that might make it to Amazon
        Top 50.
